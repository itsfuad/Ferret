// Ferret runtime: Interface support
// VTable-based interface implementation (similar to Go)
// This file is minimal - most interface code is generated inline

#include "interface.h"

// This file is mostly a placeholder
// VTable structs and instances are generated inline in the main C file
// for each interface/implementation pair
