description: Try Ferret in your browser with syntax highlighting
template: doc
---
Try writing Ferret code directly in your browser! The playground features:

- **Full syntax highlighting** for Ferret keywords, types, and operators
- **Monaco Editor** - the same editor that powers VS Code
- **Theme support** - automatically matches your dark/light preference

:::tip
Use `Ctrl/Cmd + Space` for autocomplete and `Ctrl/Cmd + /` to toggle comments!
:::

Go to the [Playground](/play/) to try it out!

:::note
Code execution is coming soon! For now, enjoy syntax highlighting and code editing. We're working on integrating the Ferret compiler for real-time execution.
