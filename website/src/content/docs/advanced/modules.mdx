import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Modules in ferret are nothing but files. Each file is a module, and the module name is derived from the file path from the root of the project.

For example, if you have a file structure like this:

<FileTree>
- your_project
  - main.fer
  - utils
    - math.fer
    - ...
</FileTree>

The module name for `math.fer` would be `your_project/utils/math`.

## Importing Modules
To use a module in another file, you use the `import` statement followed by the module path.
```ferret
import "your_project/utils/math";
```
To use access functions or variables from the imported module, you use the module name as a prefix followed by `::` and then the function or variable name.
```ferret
let result := math::Some_function();
```
You can also use `as` to create an alias for the module to shorten the name or avoid naming conflicts.
```ferret 
import "your_project/utils/math" as m;
let result := m::Some_function();
```

## Exporting from Modules
Exporting means, which symbols (functions, variables, types) are accessible from outside the module. The public symbols are usually written in UpperCase, while private symbols are in lowercase. We follow this convention to differentiate between public and private symbol.
```ferret
// In your_project/utils/math.fer
fn PublicFunction() {
    // This function is public and can be accessed from outside the module
}
fn privateFunction() {
    // This function is private and cannot be accessed from outside the module
}
```
