Welcome to the Ferret blog! This space will collect release notes, deep dives into the language design, and short how-tos for features like optionals, maps, and interfaces.

What to expect next:

- Regular progress reports on the compiler and runtime.
- Guides that complement the docs with worked examples.
- Design discussions around upcoming features (generics, better tooling, IDE support).

If you have topics you’d like us to cover, open an issue on GitHub and let us know.
