MIR generation covers functions, blocks, if/else, while, match (literal patterns), calls, arithmetic, loads/stores, struct field access, fixed arrays, dynamic arrays. Fixed arrays now require consteval index (negatives allowed) with compile-time error T0028 for non-const; MIR uses constant ptr_add offsets (no runtime bounds checks). Dynamic arrays still emit runtime checks. Optionals/results/coalescing in MIR. Map indexing and map_set emit MIR map_get/map_set ops. Debug -d writes .mir files. Missing: MIR lowering for map literals, map iteration, for/foreach, range expr, dynamic array literals in expressions, result/catch paths, backend MIR->target. Decide runtime OOB behavior for dynamic arrays."}
