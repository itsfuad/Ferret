# Ferret Programming Language
Welcome to Ferret! Ferret is a statically typed, beginner-friendly programming language designed to bring clarity, simplicity, and expressiveness to developers. With a focus on readability and a clean syntax, Ferret makes it easier to write clear, maintainable code while embracing modern programming principles.

Key Features
- Statically Typed: Strong typing ensures that errors are caught early, making your code more predictable and robust.
- Beginner-Friendly: Ferretâ€™s syntax is designed to be easy to read and understand, even for new developers.
- Expressive Code: With simple syntax and clear semantics, Ferret is made to be highly expressive without unnecessary complexity.
- First-Class Functions: Functions are treated as first-class citizens, enabling functional programming paradigms while maintaining simplicity.
- Clear Structs and Interfaces: Structs have methods and are used for simplicity, with implicit interface implementation for cleaner code.
